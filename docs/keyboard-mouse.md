# Record and replay keyboard/mouse play

Play naturally once: move, jump, explore, open menus, build or break things.
The rig saves your physical input and can replay that same session while making
a video. You choose what to do; no prescribed movement sequence is required.
Replay repeats those choices and timings. It does not learn to play or adapt to
changes in the game.

This walkthrough uses the **0.2.0 source snapshot**. npm still serves 0.1.0,
which does not include keyboard/mouse support.

## The easy way: desktop controls

Download this repository with **Code → Download ZIP**, extract it, and
double-click **Start Rig.cmd**. It finds Node.js or downloads a verified local
copy on first start; no Node install, process IDs or terminal commands are needed.
You need Windows 10/11 x64 and your own installed game.

1. Open the game in windowed/borderless mode. Preserve a baseline save and pause
   at the starting point (see the save procedure below).
2. Choose the game in the list. **Refresh** finds newly opened games.
3. Click **Record new session**. Leave **Include video** checked for footage;
   ffmpeg is downloaded and verified once if it is missing (161 MB). Uncheck it
   for input-only recording. Setup can be cancelled with **Stop**.
4. The app brings your chosen game forward once and shows a five-second countdown.
   Release the controls, then play naturally when **REC** appears. **F8 stops**.
5. The controls return with the saved take in **Saved sessions**. Names, files
   and folders are automatic. A take with no physical input is reported as such.
6. Save/close the game, preserve the changed save, and restore the complete baseline.
   Reopen at the same camera, inventory and pause/menu state. Click **Refresh**,
   choose the game and saved session, check the reset reminder, then **Replay selected**.
7. Leave the controls alone during replay. It ends on its own; F8 aborts. Watch
   the result with **Watch video**, and use **Open recordings** for the full files.

The app keeps files in `Videos/Qaping Rig` under your user folder. Each session
has its original `input.kbmscript.json`, capture sidecar, optional `human.mp4`,
and a `replays` folder with separate runs. **Watch video** opens that session's
latest recording/replay. **Import session** copies an existing trace unchanged;
it does not copy a video referenced by an imported file. Authored/generated
imports are labelled so they cannot be mistaken for a physical take.

The app handles recording controls, not game saves or game-specific compatibility.
Restore the same window size and starting view before replay. It will not bypass
a game's input restrictions or adapt to a changed world. Desktop sessions have
the same 35-minute ceiling as the CLI. Advanced CLI instructions follow.

## CLI: 1. Get the tool and video prerequisites

You need Windows 10/11 x64, Node.js 20 or newer, a physical keyboard/mouse, and
a local game you can run. Stock Windows PowerShell supplies the native input
backend. No Python, controller or ViGEmBus driver is needed for this mode.

With Git installed, open PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/alex-durango/qaping-rig.git
cd qaping-rig
node bin/rig.js version
```

Alternatively use GitHub's **Code → Download ZIP**, extract it, and open a
terminal in that folder. There are no npm dependencies to install. `npm test`
runs the source checks; these do not establish compatibility with your game.

For video, install a [Windows ffmpeg build](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows)
and put its `bin` folder on PATH. Or set its actual executable path in the same
PowerShell session, for example:

```powershell
$env:RIG_FFMPEG = 'C:\Tools\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe'
node bin/rig.js doctor --input keyboard-mouse
```

Read each doctor result. It also checks optional PresentMon and hardware
encoding and may exit nonzero when they are absent. PresentMon is not needed
for the commands below: replay uses `--no-telemetry`. Without a working hardware
encoder the recorder tries software capture, which can slow the game. For
input only, omit `--video` when recording and add `--no-capture` to replay.

Run the game and rig at the same privilege level. Telemetry needs an elevated
terminal, but the keyboard/mouse workflow without telemetry can run normally.
Use the interactive desktop; switching Windows sessions or connecting through
RDP can disrupt capture. Video captures the desktop, including the status panel
and any other visible windows. Keep private content off the recorded display.

## 2. Preserve a starting point

Use a disposable single-player save or checkpoint. Choose windowed or borderless
mode so the status panel is visible. Keep the game on the captured display.

Before recording, preserve a baseline with the game's backup/copy/export
feature. If backing up files yourself, save and fully close the game first,
then copy the complete save folder. Do not copy a live save database. Keep
the baseline untouched and preserve changed saves separately.

Write down the game's version, save/checkpoint, player position and camera,
inventory, selected item, window size, resolution, UI scale, mouse DPI,
Windows pointer settings, in-game sensitivity and key bindings. A screenshot
of the starting view helps you compare it after a reset. Restoring only the
blocks or level layout does not restore the player's state.

Reopen the baseline, reach the starting point, and pause if the game captures
the mouse. The pause/menu state is part of the baseline too. Do not change the
window size after recording begins.

Find the actual game process in **Task Manager → Details**. Note its PID and
use **Open file location** to identify its executable and directory. Select the
game process, not a launcher. The examples use PID `1234` and
`C:\Games\YourGame\game.exe`; replace them with your values.

## 3. Record your play

From the source folder:

```powershell
node bin/rig.js record --input keyboard-mouse --pid 1234 --out sessions/take-01.kbmscript.json --video sessions/take-01.mp4 --max-minutes 2
```

The command creates the output folder. The **Start recording** panel waits
until you use it, cancel with F8, or close the game/command. It has no idle
timeout and records no video while waiting.

1. Click **Start recording**. F9 is an optional shortcut while the game has focus.
2. Release the controls. **Preparing video** changes to a visible **5…1** countdown
   after the first video frame is encoded. There is nothing to count yourself.
3. When **REC** and the timer appear, resume the game and play freely. Clicking
   Resume or pressing Escape are both valid choices; that action is recorded too.
4. Press **F8** while the game has focus to finish. Wait for the terminal to print
   the trace path, physical event count, duration and stop reason.

The two-minute limit in this example counts active input time, excluding idle
waiting and countdown. F8 also cancels before recording. If no physical input
was captured, the command says nothing was written; that is not a saved take.
Switching focus stops a session. The rig does not pull focus back from another app.

Keep these three files together:

| File | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `sessions/take-01.kbmscript.json` | Original timed physical input |
| `sessions/take-01.kbmscript.json.capture.json` | Trace/video hashes, stop reason, video start timing and warnings |
| `sessions/take-01.mp4` | Desktop video, including countdown and a short tail |

Check that the terminal reports physical events, the sidecar's stop reason is
what you intended, and its video failure/warnings do not indicate a broken
capture. Watch the video before using the take. The trace's clock starts at REC,
not at the beginning of the video.

The panel closes when the command finishes. **To record again, rerun the command
with new names**, such as `take-02`. Existing output files are never overwritten.
You do not need a new take merely because the previous panel closed.

## 4. Restore and replay

Save and close the game. Preserve the post-recording save, then restore the
complete baseline. Reopen it with the same settings, camera, inventory, window
size and pause/menu state. Check against your starting screenshot. The rig
does not manage saves or reset your world for you.

Find the new game PID; it changes when the game restarts. Then run:

```powershell
node bin/rig.js play 'C:\Games\YourGame' --exe game.exe --pid 1234 --script sessions/take-01.kbmscript.json --no-telemetry
```

Click **Start replay**, release the controls, and let the countdown finish.
Leave the mouse and keyboard alone during **REPLAY**. The recording already
contains the resume action, menu clicks and gameplay. F8 aborts and releases
held inputs. A completed replay stops on its own at the end of the trace.

Attachment checks that the PID belongs to the specified executable and leaves
the game running afterward. If your game supports direct launch, omit `--pid`
to let the rig launch it; wait at Start until its save and menus are ready.
Use the normal launcher and PID attachment for games that need a launcher.

New traces store visible menu cursor positions inside the game window, so a
click on a chest's X does not depend on where the pointer started. Hidden-camera
motion remains relative input. Match the recorded client size and UI scale;
replay refuses a resized client or a menu point covered by another window.

`--countdown 10` changes the button-triggered countdown. `--start-delay 5`
instead explicitly selects an automatic countdown after preparation, without
waiting for Start. Use it only when the game is already ready and will have
focus at countdown expiry. `--no-status` hides the panel. F8/F9 are reserved
transport keys and are not recorded as gameplay.

## 5. Check what actually happened

The terminal prints a new `rig-runs/<run-id>/receipt.json` path. In that same
folder, open `recording.mp4`, `inputs.jsonl` and `inputs-timing.jsonl`. Read a
summary with the actual run folder:

```powershell
node bin/rig.js report 'rig-runs/<run-id>'
```

Check the receipt's script hash against your original trace, `events_sent`,
`stop_reason`, warnings and timing. A complete input replay ends with
`script_end`. Compare the video with the human take: did it resume, reach the
same places, operate the menus and finish the intended actions?

A `pass` receipt means the observed input/run checks completed; it does **not**
mean the gameplay matched. A missed click or a different camera angle can change
the result without crashing. Missing telemetry means there are no frame-time
measurements. The `overlay` command draws controller inputs only; it does not
generate a keyboard/mouse graphic. The live REC/REPLAY status panel is separate.

Before depending on a route, repeat it from three independent baseline restores.
Keep every attempt, including misses and setup refusals. Use the same original
trace. If you deliberately alter the level to see the limitation, use a separate
save and label the change; do not describe it as a bug or an adaptive replay.

## Minecraft example

Minecraft is optional and is not bundled. Use your own local Windows installation
and a disposable world. One physical session on **Bedrock 1.21.130 / Windows 11**
replayed a bridge crossing, chest inventory clicks, its close X, chest destruction
and collection, and the return to a start marker. Camera alignment differed
slightly, including before replay input. This is one observed route completion,
not evidence of exact repeatability or compatibility with Java/other versions.

To make a small place to try your own play, create a flat world with cheats
enabled, Creative mode, Peaceful difficulty, daylight and no spawned mobs.
Use ordinary blocks or these commands in that disposable world:

```text
/tp @s 1.5 -60 1.5 0 8
/fill -3 -60 -3 5 -60 16 stone
/fill -1 -56 -1 3 -56 4 stone
/fill -1 -56 9 3 -56 14 stone
/fill 0 -56 5 2 -56 8 oak_planks
/setblock 1 -56 1 emerald_block
/setblock 1 -56 12 gold_block
/setblock 1 -55 12 chest
/tp @s 1.5 -55 1.5 0 8
/gamemode survival
```

This gives you two platforms, a short bridge, a chest and a catch floor. Empty
your inventory, choose a hotbar slot, save/close and preserve the complete baseline
before playing. On reopening, verify Survival, camera and inventory, then pause
and record. The course is just a place to play; you can choose any actions.

For replay, follow the full restore procedure above. Do not just replace the
chest: the save includes your position, inventory and other state. Minecraft
save locations vary by installation/version, so find your actual world through
the game's save/export tools rather than assuming a machine-specific path.

## Recovery

For the desktop app:

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| The launcher does not open | Extract the ZIP first, then double-click Start Rig.cmd inside the extracted folder. First start needs an internet connection; a setup error stays visible in the launcher window. |
| The game is missing | Open the game, then click Refresh. Run the game and rig at the same privilege level. |
| No countdown over the game | Use windowed/borderless mode. Let video preparation finish before expecting the countdown. |
| F8 appears not to stop | Check any keyboard Fn/F-lock behavior. Switch back to Qaping Rig and click Stop if it is still active; leaving the game also ends input. Let it finish saving. |
| The controls disappear | During play the control panel minimizes. It should return after completion. Reopen Start Rig.cmd if the app closed; your saved sessions remain on disk. |
| Replay is disabled | Choose a running game and saved session, restore that game's starting point, then check the reset reminder. |
| Video setup fails | Check the internet connection and retry. Uncheck Include video to record/replay inputs without video. Show details has the specific error. |
| Replay stops or goes off course | Read the message and Show details. Restore the starting save, camera, menu and window size before retrying; check the game-specific limits below. |

### Advanced CLI recovery

These entries refer to commands launched in a terminal. The one-shot CLI panel
closes after a session; the desktop app returns to its saved-session controls.

| What you see | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| No Start panel | Check whether the command is still armed. Use windowed/borderless mode and omit `--no-status`. A completed command needs a fresh invocation. |
| F9 has a game action or the button is hard to reach | Pause to release the pointer and click Start. Wait for REC before resuming. F9 is optional. |
| F8 appears not to stop | Check game focus and any keyboard Fn/F-lock behavior. If needed, Ctrl+C in the rig terminal requests a stop; wait for its final output. |
| Panel disappears after F8 | Expected after completion. Inspect the terminal and saved files before starting another take with new names. |
| Client size differs | Restore the same window size/maximized state, resolution and UI scale. Do not bypass the guard or edit recorded coordinates. Automation that activates a window may also restore it; verify the size before starting. |
| Menu point is covered | Move the covering window away. If any gameplay ran, restore the baseline before retrying. |
| Replay remains paused or misses X | Check the pause/menu state and whether the trace contains visible cursor positions. Older traces cannot recover those positions; make a fresh physical recording with this version. |
| Camera or route drifts | Check the starting view, sensitivity, DPI and settings. Some games treat synthetic input differently; keep the unsuccessful attempt and evaluate compatibility. |
| Video preparation/capture fails | Check `RIG_FFMPEG` and doctor. Try `--capture-mode gdigrab` for software capture, or omit video / use `--no-capture` to isolate input. |
| PID/executable mismatch or access denied | Resolve the current game PID and actual executable path, and match privilege levels. Do not use a launcher PID. |

Absolute pointing devices, E1 keys such as Pause, and games drawing their own
pointer while hiding the Windows cursor need separate compatibility work. This
is game input replay, not automation for credentials or private chat text.
Keep recordings private until you have reviewed them; `sessions/` and replay
output folders are ignored by Git in this source checkout.
